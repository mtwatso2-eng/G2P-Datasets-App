Version 0.9-1

	* setAllperms<-.how() was stripping the "allPerms" class. (#16)

	Reported by: @brendanf

	* nobs: added a `nobs.character` method (#17)

	* get-methods: added a `getControl()` extractor with a default
	method and a method for class `"check"`. There is an alias in
	the form of `getHow()` (#18)

	* shuffle: now accepts objects from which we derive the number
	of observations, bringing is into line with `shuffleSet()`

Version 0.9-0

	* Release to CRAN 23 Jan 2016

Version 0.8-5

	* shuffleSet gains new argument `quietly = FALSE`, which is
	passed on to `check()` to allow control over printing of
	statements during checking.

	Reported by: (and fixed by) Jari Oksanen

	* allPerms would return a vector instead of a matrix when a
	single permutation was generated.

	Reported by: (and fixed by) Jari Oksanen

	* Better defaults for `check()` heuristics allow for more
	reliable (i.e. fewer duplicate permutations) permutations when
	the set of permutations is small.

	Provided by: Jari Oksanen

	* allStrata did not handle cases where strata were not in
	contiguous blocks:
	e.g. `c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)` vs `c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)`

	Reported by: David Warton

	* Permutation matrices returned by `shuffleSet()` now print the
	permutations more compactfully.

	* as.matrix.allPerms: new S3 method for class `allPerms`.

	* Code coverage: permute now has a test suite that covers
	~87% of the current code base.

Version 0.8-4

	* Update testthat unit testing to recommended usage.

	Reported by: Hadley Wickham

	* Example using vegan data is now made conditional upon that
	package being available.

	Reported by: Jari Oksanen
	Fix suggested by: Uwe Ligges

	* blocks new in-devel extractor and replacement function `blocks`.
	These are not currently exported so use at your own risk...

	* permute-deprecate.Rd was missing an \alias{}

	Reported by: Kurt Hornik (CRAN)

Version 0.8-3

	* allPerms: with free permutations *within* plots, `allPerms()`
	was not returning the indices in the original data but in the
	permutation indices within plots.

	Reported by: Joris Meys

Version 0.8-2

	* allPerms: with free permutations *within* blocks, `allPerms()`
	was not returning the indices in the original data but in the
	permutation indices within block.

	In addition, `allPerms()` was not replicating each row in a
	within-block permutation matrix for all the rows in the other
	block within-block permutation matrices. This is now achieved via
	a new, non-exported utility function `cbindAllPerms()`.

	Reported by: Joris Meys

Version 0.8-1

	* setBlocks: get block name before doing anything so that you
	really get only name instead of its evaluated value.

Version 0.8-0

	* Released to CRAN

	* DESCRIPTION: now uses `Authors@R` to populate `Author` and
	`Maintainer` fields. Finer grained recognition of contributors and
	R Core Team's copyright.

	* NEWS: added a `NEWS.Rd` file to document high-level changes to
	permute. Detailed changes remain in `ChangeLog`, whilst `NEWS.Rd`
	will summarise the main user-level changes to the package.

	* allPerms: fix a bug where the blocks of permutations were being
	recombined in the wrong way, by rows instead of by columns.

	* numPerms: was ignoring the `constant` setting if free permutations
	within level of plots.

Version 0.7-8

	* how, Plots: enforces that `blocks` and `strata` are factors, or
	can be coerced to a factor via `as.factor()`, if specified.

	* check: gains a new argument `quietly = FALSE` to suppress messages
	about updates to the permutation design when they are not needed.

	* allPerms: no longer allows  messages about generating set of
	permutations to be generated by `check()`. It calls `check()` now
	with `quietly = TRUE` to achieve this.

	* shuffleSet: played about a bit with the way the design is printed
	if you show the matrix of permutations.

Version 0.7-7

	* shuffleSet: Implemented an idea of Jari's to allow `check()` and
	`allPerms()` to do their thing and possibly generate the set of all
	permutations, rather than turn off checking. If that now results in
	more than `nset` permutations, `shuffleSet` randomly takes `nset` of
	these. This is a nice suggestion as it avoids the problem that with
	small numbers of possible permutations, you can randomly draw the
	same permutation more than once.

	As I have added this feature, I reverted some earlier changes to the
	documentation that used the `check = FALSE` in their call to
	`shuffleSet()`. The `check` argument is retained though, as a way for
	function writers to skip that part of the permute workflow if desired.

	The permutation matrix returned is now of class `"permutationMatrix"`.
	This class has `as.matrix()` and `print()` S3 methods.

	* allPerms: gains an argument `check`, which defaults to `TRUE`. This
	is used to turn off checking within `allPerms` if desired. A use-case
	for this is in `check()`, which might end up caling `allPerms()` to
	generate the set of all permutations. In that case `allPerms()` used
	to recheck the design. Now this doesn't happen.

	`allPerms` also uses the new `set<-` replacement functions rather than
	`update()` as the latter causes problems when used within functions as
	it often evaluates the stored call in the wrong environment.

	* check: following the change to `allPerms` (see above), `check()` no
	longer results in it calling itself, via `allPerms()`, when generating
	the set of possible permutations if the check heuristics indicate it
	should be.

	Turned on some `message()`s when the user asks for too many permutations
	(more than the set of possible permutations) and when the set of
	possible permutations is smaller than the `minperm` value stored in the
	`"how"` object. The latter notifies the user that the entire set of
	permutations is being generated. These messages were updated to reduce
	their length.

	`check` also uses the new `set<-` replacement functions rather than
	`update()` as the latter causes problems when used within functions as
	it often evaluates the stored call in the wrong environment.

	* Plots, Within: now return a object of class `"Plots"` or `"Within"`,
	respectively.

	* get-methods: added a number of a new methods for existing functions
	to work with `"Within"` and `"Plots"` classes.

	* set-methods: added a number of a new functions and methods with the
	common name `setFoo<-.Bar` where `Foo` is the component to be updated,
	and `Bar` is the class. These are replacement functions only. They are
	intended to be used within functions, where the user-friendly `update()`
	will have problems getting the call updated correctly ot evaluating it.

	* how, Plots, Within: Now work much harder to preserve details of the
	design (i.e. the names of objects passed for the blocks or plot strata),
	and also process the matched call so that the user can `update()` it.

	* fixupCall: a new, unexported function that allows the call objects
	stored in a `"how"` object to be updated. This is not exported as it is
	intended only for internal use. Function writers should use the
	`setFoo<-` functions instead. Ordinary users should use `update()` as
	long as it is not in a function.

	* update: new methods for objects of classes `"how"` and `"Plots".
	Thes are copies of the standard R function `update.default` with some
	changes. The source files for these two functions preserver the R
	copyright statement and document modifications made by Gavin L.
	Simpson.

	* Depends: permute requires a version of R no earlier than version
	2.14.0.

Version 0.7-6

	* summary.allPerms: Was printing two slightly different subtitles.

	* More unit tests...

Version 0.7-5

	* how: the matched call is now returned permitting the use of
	`update()` to update elements of a stored permutation design object.
	Suggested by Jari Oksanen.

	`how` also gains an argument `make` which is the user-level way
	to control whether all possible permutations are actually
	created should the heuristics in `check()` decide they should be.

	The `print` method for class "how" wasn't printing details of
	mirroring or constant settings for within-plot components.

	* shuffleSet: was incorrectly recombining individual block-level
	permutations.
	Reported by Jari Oksanen.

	Gains an argument, `check`, which allows the user to control whether
	the permutation design should be checked. In small data sets or where
	there are very few permutations, `shuffleSet` could generate more
	permutations (i.e. all possible ones) than requested. Turning off this
	checking with `check = FALSE` will result in exactly `nset`
	permutations being returned, but without a gaurantee that they will
	be unique.

	* numPerms: fixed a bug where `numPerms()` was ignoring Blocks when
	computing the number of possible permutations.

	* Within, Plots: as with `how()`, the matched call is now returned
	as part of the list object, allowing desirable `update()` behaviour.

	* allPerms, doAllPerms: now correctly work in presence of blocks,
	and where there are no plots.

	  `allPerms` now includes the permutation design (its `control`
	  argument) as an attribute, `"control"`, on the returned matrix of
	  permutations.

	  `allPerms` loses arguments `max` and `observed` as these are
	  supposed to be in the control object created by `how()`.

	  `summary.allPerms` (its `print` method, more correctly) now prints
	  the permutation design alongside the set of permutations.

	* get-methods: new extractor functions `getObserved()` and
	`getMake()` return the `observed` and `make` components of object
	created by `how()`.

	* getComplete: This now only returns the `complete` component of
	the `"how"` object. Use `getMinperm()` to extract the component
	no-longer returned by `getComplete()`.

	* check: function loses arguments `make.all` and `observed` as
	these are in the control object returned by `how()`.

	The logic of some of the checks has been tweaked slightly.

	* Documentation fixes in examples of `allPerms` and `check`.

	* permuplot: This is horribly broken and I'm not sure if it will
	ever return. In the meantime, this function now prints a warning
	message if used and returns nothing, invisibly.

	The function is no longer exported from the package namespace, and
	not documented.

	I'm not convinced that the plot can adequately convery the breadth of
	designs now possible. Hence I am minded to deprecate this in 0.8-0
	when released to CRAN and to make it defunct some thereafter.

Version 0.7-4

	* Deprecated functions: Completed the deprecation of `permCheck()`
	and `permControl()`. These functions will be made defunct following
	the release of version 0.8-0, with a view to complete removal from
	version 0.9-0 onwards.

Version 0.7-3

	* Tweak to 0.7-2 API changes: argument `blocks` no longer takes
	a list from helper function `Blocks()`. It is easier and simpler
	if this just takes a factor. In essence, `blocks` in synonymous
	with `strata` from `vegan::permuted.index` and the new change will
	allow for an easier transition.

	* get-methods: New extractor functions `getMirror()`, and
	`getConstant()` which retrieve the mirroring and constant elements
	of a permutation design.

	Also added `getRow()`, `getCol()` and `getDim()`, which extract
	the row and column dimensions of a grid permutation design, or
	both.

	In addition, new methods `getNperm()` and `getMaxperm()` return
	the number of permutations requested and the maximum nuber that
	should be allowed, respectively. New method `getComplete` extracts
	details of the complete enumeration features of permute.

	* numPerms: updated to work with the new API and now handles
	blocking. Exmaples now pass checks again.

	* allPerms: updated to the new API.

	* check: updated to the new API.

	* how: new function, a copy of `permControl()` and will eventually
	replace that function. Has a new `print` method.

	Begun process of *deprecating* `permControl()` and its `print`
	method.

	* permControl, how: the `strata.name` component of the returned
	object is no called `blocks.name`.

	* Plots: now returns the object name supplied as argument `strata`
	as component `plots.name`.

	* TODO: started a TODO list of things I know are broken or needed.

Version 0.7-2

	* Major API change: Added capability to handle true blocking
	constraints.
	Suggested by Cajo ter Braak.

	We now have:

	  o Blocks: samples are *never* permuted between blocks. Blocks
	    can't be permuted either.
	  o Plots: these define groups of samples, for example the
	    whole plots in a split-plot design, or repeated measures
	    on a set of sites. The sites are the "plots". Plots can
	    be permuted using any of the restricted schemes offered
	    in permute.
	  o Within: these are the samples, the rows in the data set.
	    They can be nested in Plots and/or in Blocks.

	This capability has made it into permControl(), shuffle() and
	shuffleSet(), though the latter certainly has one major bug
	in the case where there is more than one Block.

	Most other functionality is broken as the above change has
	altered the permControl object in a way that is not backwards
	compatible.

	Note that the 0.7.x branch is a development branch and should
	not be used in ernest until I work through all the implications
	of this change. Rest assured, I won't be doing this again!

Version 0.7-1

	* allPerms: implement Doug Bates version which simplifies and
	speeds up the code. A fast RcppEigen-based version also exists
	but will need larger changes to the package to implement.

Version 0.7-0

	* Vignette: silly typo is example code illustrating shuffle().
	New section on `shuffleSet()`.

	The Vignette is now in `vignettes` not `inst/doc`.

	* check.Rd: undo the hack needed to pass checks prior to
	vegan 2.0 being on CRAN.

	* Suggests: now needs vegan >= 2.0-0

	* shuffleGrid: was doing random flipping of permutations even
	if `mirror = FALSE` for the `constant = TRUE` case.

	* shuffleStrata: assumed that the samples were in contiguous
	blocks.
	Reported by Cajo ter Braak.

	* .Internal: removed all instances of .Internal calls in the
	code.

	* Package is now byte-compiled.

Version 0.6-1 (released to CRAN on September 7, 2011)

	* NAMESPACE: export(permuplot)

	* check.Rd: temporarily supress some of the examples to run
	only on vegan >= 2.0-0. Needed during transition to pass
	checks on CRAN until version 2.0-0 is released.

Version 0.6-0 (closed September 7, 2011)

	* allPerms: added warning regarding current need for samples
	to be arranged in order of any strata.

	* Release: Pushed to CRAN. First beta release.

Version 0.5-4 (opened August 31, 2011)

	* permCheck: deprecate `permCheck()` in favour of `check()`.

	* allPerms: code clean-up

	* preparing for first release to CRAN.

Version 0.5-3 (closed August 31, 2011)

	* shuffleSet: now handles all permutation types that are
	available in shuffle().

	* nobs.Rd: fixed an example which created a numeric vector of
	zeros instead of changing sampled vector to numeric. The example
	yielded an error in R 2.14.0 (under development) where only one
	argument was accepted for numeric() and two or more args cause an
	error. The two isTRUE() cases should be true only exceptionally,
	and may call for a fix.

	* NAMESPACE, nobs-methods.R: The package relied on import(stats,
	nobs), but that works only in R 2.13 and failed in R 2.12.2. Now
	we define and export nobs() generic in permute package for older
	R. The help file still gives a warning for missing documentation
	of nobs in R 2.12.2 and prior, but there is no obvious fix to
	this.

Version 0.5-2 (closed August 23, 2011)

	* shuffelSet: new function to generate a set of `n`
	permutations without the overhead of `n` repeated calls to
	`shuffle()`. Currently only for designs without
	strata/blocks.

Version 0.5-1 (closed July 5, 2011)

	* shuffle: now returns seq_len(n) for no permutation within
	blocks or of blocks.

	* tests: testing using the `testthat` package. Initial
	infrasctructure.

Version 0.5-0 (closed June 28, 2011)

	* shuffle: renamed permuted.index() to shuffle()
	* Vignette: the package has a vignette, which is very much
	a work-in-progress.

Version 0.0-3 (closed June 17, 2011)

	* NAMESPACE: permute gets a NAMESPACE. Needed to shield
	functions form ones of similar name in vegan.

Version 0.0-2 (closed December 09, 2010)

	* allPerms: Large update. allPerms now works for all
	permutation designs *except* when permuting both blocks
	and within blocks. This exception is handled with
	.NotYetImplemented().

	* numPerms: Wasn't returning the correct number of
	permutations when WITHIN == "none" and BLOCK != "none",
	i.e. permuting strata.

	* Utils: Utility functions defined inline within allPerms
	moved to new proper functions and renamed; allFree, allSeries
	allGrid, allStrata.

Version 0.0-1 (closed February 28, 2010)

	* SVN: Uploaded code to r-forge within vegan source tree.
	This code base represents my working version as of today,
	*not* the version in vegan at that time.

Description: A set of restricted permutation designs for freely exchangeable, line transects (time series), and spatial grid designs plus permutation of blocks (groups of samples) is provided. 'permute' also allows split-plot designs, in which the whole-plots or split-plots or both can be freely-exchangeable or one of the restricted designs. The 'permute' package is modelled after the permutation schemes of 'Canoco 3.1' (and later) by Cajo ter Braak.

### Imports: nobs() only exists in R 2.13.0 for import. We define the
### same nobs() generic in permute for export in older R.
if (getRversion() >= "2.13.0") {
    importFrom("stats", "nobs")
} else {
    export(nobs)
}

### After R 3.2.x, R-Devel required all non-Base functions to be
### imported
importFrom("stats", "getCall", "runif", "update")

# permute News

## Changes in version 0.9-7

### Bug fixes

* The documented behaviour of `shuffleFree()` allowed `shuffleFree(x = 1:10)`,
  with `x` passed immediately to `sample.int()`, which is incorrect and raises
  an error in the development version of R (at the time of writing).
  Reported by Brian Ripley.

## Changes in version 0.9-6

### Bug fixes

* `allPerms()` was calling `allSeries()` with the incorrect number of
  permutations, leading to problems with `shuffleSet()` also.
  [#28 reported by Cajo ter Braak](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/permute/issues/28)

## Changes in version 0.9-5

Changes to accommodate the new RNG in R >= 3.6.0

## Changes in version 0.9-4

The example in `?check` was made to suppress package startup messages from
vegan.

## Changes in version 0.9-3

This release fixed some non-canonical-form CRAN URLs.

## Changes in version 0.9-2

This release was purely to avoid issues with CRAN as a new release of vegan had
been released and the example reference material hadn't been updated to match.

## Changes in version 0.9-1

### General

A minor bug fix release to address a single problem.

### Bug Fixes

 * `shuffleSet()` wasn't returning a matrix if `nset = 1` *and* `allPerms` was
   invoked because of a low set of possible permutations.
   [GitHub Issue #19](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/permute/issues/19)

## Changes in version 0.9-0

### General

This is small update to **permute**, focused mainly on ensuring the 
many combinations of restrictions on permutations allowed by the 
package work. An extensive test suite has been written which covers 
~87% of the package's codebase at the time of release.

### New features

* Permutation matrices produced by `shuffleSet()` are now printed in a 
more compact form.

* Better heuristics in `check()` allow for more reliable permutations 
(i.e. fewer duplicate permutations) when the set is small. This has 
increased the `minperms` setting. Consequently we generate all possible 
permutations up to ~500,000 more often as we now randomly sample from 
the entirely generated set rather than randomly generate permutations. 
This provides a small performance hit in some rare cases.

* `shuffleSet()` has a new argument `quietly = FALSE` which is passed 
on to `check()`.

* A number of bugs were fixed. See the Changelog and the Bug reports on 
github for details.

### Defunct

* `permControl()` and `permuplot()` are defunct and have been removed 
from the package.

## Changes in version 0.8-0

### General

* Version 0.8-0 represents a major update of **permute**, with some 
backwards-incompatible changes to the main functions. The main addition 
is the availability of block-level restrictions on the permutations, 
which are required for whole- and split-plot designs.

### New features

* `how()`, a new function to create permutation designs. This replaces 
the deprecated function `permControl`.

* **permute** gains the addition of true blocking structures with which 
to restrict the permutations. Blocks sit as the outermost layer of the 
permutations, and can contain plots which in turn contain samples. In 
contrasts to plots, blocks are never permuted and samples are never 
shuffled between blocks. Permutation only ever happens within blocks.

    To facilitate this, plot-level strata are now specified via 
    `Plots()` instead of via the old `strata` argument of `how()`. 
    Blocks are specified via a new argument `blocks`, which takes a 
    factor variable.

* A new suite of extractor and replacement functions is provided with 
which to interact with permutation designs created by `how(). Extractor 
functions have names `getFoo()`, where `Foo()` is a component of the 
design. Replacement functions have names `setFoo`. The replacement 
function are especially for use by package authors wishing to alter 
permutation within their functions. The extractor functions are 
recommended for all users wishing to extract features of the permutation 
design. 

* As a convenience for users, the \code{update()} function will now 
work with objects of classes `"how"`, `"Plots"` or `"Within"` to allow 
quick updating of features of the permutation design. This approach is 
intended for interactive use at the top-level and not within functions, 
where the new `setFoo` replacement functions should be used.

* `shuffleSet()` is enhanced in this version. Firstly, the function now 
returns a classed object which has a `print()` method to allow for 
compact printing of the design elements used to generate the set of 
permutations. Second, `shuffleSet()` will sample `nset` permutations 
from the entire set of permutations should a small number of possible 
permutations trigger generation of the entire set. This avoids the 
generation of a set of non-unique permutations. Finally the random seed 
that generated the set is stored as an attribute.

* `allPerms()` no longer assumes that samples are in block and/or plot 
ordering.

* The package vignette is much expanded in this version with new 
sections on using **permute** within functions that will be of interest 
to package authors wishing to use **permute** in their packages.

### Deprecated

* `permControl()` is deprecated in favour of `how()`.

* `permuplot()` is broken and effectively defunct given the changes to 
the way permutation are defined and the addition of blocks. 
`permuplot()` is no longer exported from the package namespace.

A TODO list for **permute** - or things I know are broken or needed.

 * `summary.allPerms` - is not printing the permutation scheme.
   *Done in 0.7-5*

 * `print.permControl` - this needs to be updated to new API, and I don't
   like the `*** Foo ***` headings I used before. *Done in 0.7-3*

 * Need a way to update the permutation scheme, e.g. when a control
   object already exists and want to tweak it. Example is in `?allPerms`
   where I turn mirroring on via

        ctrl$within$mirror <- TRUE

    But how? Best idea currently is an `update.permControl` method. The
    generic is in namespace `stats`. Or a `modify()` function, perhaps
    coupled with specific replacement functions for certain components.
   
    *DONE, in part, in 0.7-5* The matched call is now returned by `how()`
    and this allows `update()` to do its work with no further effort from
    me. What isn't so neat is that currently this means you need to type
    out in full any specification of `within` and `plots` as these take
    the results of function calls. Hence we have, from `./man/how.Rd`
    
        plts <- gl(4,10)
        blks <- gl(2,20)
        h1 <- how(within = Within(type = "series", mirror = TRUE),
                  plots = Plots(strata = plts, type = "series"),
                  blocks = blks)

        ## The design can be updated...
        ## ... remove the blocking:
        update(h1, blocks = NULL)
        ## ... or switch the type of shuffling at a level:
        update(h1, plots = Plots(strata = plts, type = "none"))
        
    Where in the second `update()` the entire `Plots()` call needs to
    repeated to change just one part, the `type`.

    This has been tweaked a bit. The second example can now be done via:
    
        update(h1, plots = update(getPlots(h1), type = "none"))
    
    Here `getPlots(h1)` returns the `plots` component, which too has 
    a `call` component and hence can be `update()`ed, hence the nested 
    calls to `update()`.
         
 * `permControl` - deprecate this in favour of `how` as in "how to 
   permute"? *DONE Completed in 0.7-4*

 * `permuplot` - this may be fundamentally bust - it only worked in the
   original API and never got updated. Now the API is 2 versions further
   on! It is also more complex than the original - not sure it'll be
   easy without a lot of work to visualise all possible schemes.

 * `check` insists on returning all permutations *without* the observed
   one.

   *DONE Completed somewhere, probably when I made observed only work via
   how()*

 * The following example from `shuffleSet()` gives same number of 
   permutations via `numPerms()` for both designs; should be fewer if 
   same permutation within each plot.
   
        ## 10 random permutations in presence of Plot-level strata
        plotStrata <- Plots(strata = gl(4,5))
        CTRL <- how(plots = plotStrata,
                    within = Within(type = "free"))
        shuffleSet(20, 10, control = CTRL)
        ## as above but same random permutation within Plot-level strata
        CTRL <- how(plots = plotStrata,
                    within = Within(type = "free", constant = TRUE))
        shuffleSet(20, 10, CTRL)

    *DONE in 0.8-0*

 * Write an Rd page for the `"permutationMatrix"` S3 class where I can 
   describe the object returned by `shuffleSet()` and the methods 
   available for it.

    *DONE in 0.7-8*‹      r‰0âŠàb```b`â’Ì@&`bN fËJLÎNÌa``«b`àb‡80pˆ: ¡£ t,T<Ê†ÊÇ8@åPåcPõÃÔÃÍE“r@•BÓ¥îå¹êb0q5trRËRsŠ,¨

# Introduction

In classical frequentist statistics, the significance of a relationship or model is determined by reference to a null distribution for the test statistic. This distribution is derived mathematically and the probability of achieving a test statistic as large or larger if the null hypothesis were true is looked-up from this null distribution. In deriving this probability, some assumptions about the data or the errors are made. If these assumptions are violated, then the validity of the derived $p$-value may be questioned.

An alternative to deriving the null distribution from theory is to generate a null distribution of the test statistic by randomly shuffling the data in some manner, refitting the model and deriving values for the test statistic for the permuted data. The level of significance of the test can be computed as the proportion of values of the test statistic from the null distribution that are equal to or larger than the observed value.

In many data sets, simply shuffling the data at random is inappropriate; under the null hypothesis, that data are not freely exchangeable, for example if there is temporal or spatial correlation, or the samples are clustered in some way, such as multiple samples collected from each of a number of fields. The *permute* package was designed to provide facilities for generating these restricted permutations for use in randomisation tests. *permute* takes as its motivation the permutation schemes originally available in *Canoco* version 3.1 [@canoco31], which employed the cyclic- or toroidal-shifts suggested by @besagclifford.

# Simple randomisation {#sec:simple}
As an illustration of both randomisation and simple usage of the *permute* package we consider a small data set of mandible length measurements on specimens of the golden jackal (*Canis aureus*) from the British Museum of Natural History, London, UK. These data were collected as part of a study comparing prehistoric and modern canids [@higham80], and were analysed by @manly07. There are ten measurements of mandible length on both male and female specimens. The data are available in the `jackal` data frame supplied with *permute*.

```{r, load_jackal}
library("permute")
data(jackal)
jackal
```

The interest is whether there is a difference in the mean mandible length between male and female golden jackals. The null hypothesis is that there is zero difference in mandible length between the two sexes or that females have larger mandibles. The alternative hypothesis is that males have larger mandibles. The usual statistical test of this hypothesis is a one-sided $t$ test, which can be applied using `t.test()`

```{r, ttest_jackal}
jack.t <- t.test(Length ~ Sex, data = jackal, var.equal = TRUE,
                 alternative = "greater")
jack.t
```

The observed $t$ is `r with(jack.t, round(statistic, 3))` with `r with(jack.t, parameter)` df. The probability of observing a value this large or larger if the null hypothesis were true is `r with(jack.t, round(p.value, 4))`. Several assumptions have been made in deriving this $p$-value, namely

* random sampling of individuals from the populations of interest,
* equal population standard deviations for males and females, and
* that the mandible lengths are normally distributed within the sexes.

Assumption 1 is unlikely to be valid for museum specimens such as these, that have been collected in some unknown manner. Assumption 2 may be valid, Fisher's $F$-test and a Fligner-Killeen test both suggest that the standard deviations of the two populations do not differ significantly
```{rftest_jackal}
var.test(Length ~ Sex, data = jackal)
fligner.test(Length ~ Sex, data = jackal)
```
This assumption may be relaxed using `var.equal = FALSE` (the default) in the call to `t.test()`, to employ Welch's modification for unequal variances. Assumption 3 may be valid, but with such a small sample we are unable to reliably test this.

A randomisation test of the same hypothesis can be performed by randomly allocating ten of the mandible lengths to the male group and the remaining lengths to the female group. This randomisation is justified under the null hypothesis because the observed difference in mean mandible length between the two sexes is just a typical value for the difference in a sample if there were no difference in the population. An appropriate test statistic needs to be selected. We could use the $t$ statistic as derived in the $t$-test. Alternatively, we could base our randomisation test on the difference of means $D_i$ (male - female).

The main function in *permute* for providing random permutations is `shuffle()`. We can write our own randomisation test for the `jackal` data by first creating a function to compute the difference of means for two groups
```{r, meanFun}
meanDif <- function(x, grp) {
 mean(x[grp == "Male"]) - mean(x[grp == "Female"])
}
```
which can be used in a simple `for()` loop to generate the null distribution for the difference of means. First, we allocate some storage to hold the null difference of means; here we use 4999 random permutations so allocate a vector of length 5000. Then we iterate, randomly generating an ordering of the `Sex` vector and computing the difference of means for that permutation.
```{r, randJackal}
Djackal <- numeric(length = 5000)
N <- nrow(jackal)
set.seed(42)
for(i in seq_len(length(Djackal) - 1)) {
    perm <- shuffle(N)
    Djackal[i] <- with(jackal, meanDif(Length, Sex[perm]))
}
Djackal[5000] <- with(jackal, meanDif(Length, Sex))
```
The observed difference of means was added to the null distribution, because under the null hypothesis the observed allocation of mandible lengths to male and female jackals is just one of the possible random allocations.

The null distribution of $D_i$ can be visualised using a histogram, as shown in Figure~\@ref{draw_hist_jackal}. The observed difference of means (`r round(Djackal[5000], 2)`) is indicated by the red tick mark.

```{r, hist_jackal, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
hist(Djackal, main = "",
     xlab = expression("Mean difference (Male - Female) in mm"))
rug(Djackal[5000], col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
The number of values in the randomisation distribution equal to or larger than the observed difference is
```{r}
(Dbig <- sum(Djackal >= Djackal[5000]))
```
giving a permutational $p$-value of
```{r}
Dbig / length(Djackal)
```
which is comparable with that determined from the frequentist $t$-test, and indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference.

```{r, draw_hist_jackal, fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Distribution of the difference of mean mandible length in random allocations, ten to each sex."}
<<hist_jackal>>
```

In total there $^{20}C_{10} = `r formatC(choose(20,10), big.mark = ",", format = "f", digits = 0)`$ possible allocations of the 20 observations to two groups of ten
```{r, }
choose(20, 10)
```
so we have only evaluated a small proportion of these in the randomisation test.

The main workhorse function we used above was `shuffle()`. In this example, we could have used the base R function `sample()` to generate the randomised indices `perm` that were used to permute the `Sex` factor. Where `shuffle()` comes into it's own is for generating permutation indices from restricted permutation designs.

# The `shuffle()` and `shuffleSet()` functions
In the previous section I introduced the `shuffle()` function to generate permutation indices for use in a randomisation test. Now we will take a closer look at `shuffle()` and explore the various restricted permutation designs from which it can generate permutation indices.

`shuffle()` has two arguments:

i. `n`, the number of observations in the data set to be permuted, and
ii. `control`, a list that defines the permutation design describing how the samples should be permuted.

```{r, show_args}
args(shuffle)
```
A series of convenience functions are provided that allow the user to set-up even quite complex permutation designs with little effort. The user only needs to specify the aspects of the design they require and the convenience functions ensure all configuration choices are set and passed on to `shuffle()`. The main convenience function is `how()`, which returns a list specifying all the options available for controlling the sorts of permutations returned by `shuffle()`.
```{r, show_str}
str(how())
```
The defaults describe a random permutation design where all objects are freely exchangeable. Using these defaults, `shuffle(10)` amounts to `sample(1:10, 10, replace = FALSE)`:
```{r, compare_shuffle_sample}
set.seed(2)
(r1 <- shuffle(10))
set.seed(2)
(r2 <- sample(1:10, 10, replace = FALSE))
all.equal(r1, r2)
```

## Generating restricted permutations
Several types of permutation are available in *permute*:

* Free permutation of objects
* Time series or line transect designs, where the temporal or spatial ordering is preserved.
* Spatial grid designs, where the spatial ordering is preserved in both coordinate directions
* Permutation of plots or groups of samples.
* Blocking factors which restrict permutations to within blocks. The preceding designs can be nested within blocks.

The first three of these can be nested within the levels of a factor or to the levels of that factor, or to both. Such flexibility allows the analysis of split-plot designs using permutation tests, especially when combined with blocks.

`how()` is used to set up the design from which `shuffle()` will draw a permutation. `how()` has two main arguments that specify how samples are permuted *within* plots of samples or at the plot level itself. These are `within` and `plots`. Two convenience functions, `Within()` and `Plots()` can be used to set the various options for permutation. Blocks operate at the uppermost level of this hierarchy; blocks define groups of plots, each of which may contain groups of samples.

For example, to permute the observations `1:10` assuming a time series design for the entire set of observations, the following control object would be used

```{r, series1}
set.seed(4)
x <- 1:10
CTRL <- how(within = Within(type = "series"))
perm <- shuffle(10, control = CTRL)
perm
x[perm] ## equivalent
```

It is assumed that the observations are in temporal or transect order. We only specified the type of permutation within plots, the remaining options were set to their defaults via `Within()`.

A more complex design, with three plots, and a 3 by 3 spatial grid arrangement within each plot can be created as follows

```{r, grid1}
set.seed(4)
plt <- gl(3, 9)
CTRL <- how(within = Within(type = "grid", ncol = 3, nrow = 3),
            plots = Plots(strata = plt))
perm <- shuffle(length(plt), control = CTRL)
perm
```

Visualising the permutation as the 3 matrices may help illustrate how the data have been shuffled

```{r, vis_grid1, keep.source=TRUE}
## Original
lapply(split(seq_along(plt), plt), matrix, ncol = 3)
## Shuffled
lapply(split(perm, plt), matrix, ncol = 3)
```

In the first grid, the lower-left corner of the grid was set to row 2 and column 2 of the original, to row 1 and column 2 in the second grid, and to row 3 column 2 in the third grid.

To have the same permutation within each level of `plt`, use the `constant` argument of the `Within()` function, setting it to `TRUE`
```{r, grid_2, keep.source=TRUE}
set.seed(4)
CTRL <- how(within = Within(type = "grid", ncol = 3, nrow = 3,
                            constant = TRUE),
            plots = Plots(strata = plt))
perm2 <- shuffle(length(plt), control = CTRL)
lapply(split(perm2, plt), matrix, ncol = 3)
```

## Generating sets of permutations with shuffleSet()
There are several reasons why one might wish to generate a set of $n$ permutations instead of repeatedly generating permutations one at a time. Interpreting the permutation design happens each time `shuffle()` is called. This is an unnecessary computational burden, especially if you want to perform tests with large numbers of permutations. Furthermore, having the set of permutations available allows for expedited use with other functions, they can be iterated over using `for` loops or the `apply` family of functions, and the set of permutations can be exported for use outside of R.

The `shuffleSet()` function allows the generation of sets of permutations from any of the designs available in *permute*. `shuffleSet()` takes an additional argument to that of `shuffle()`, `nset`, which is the number of permutations required for the set. `nset` can be missing, in which case the number of permutations in the set is looked for in the object passed to `control`; using this, the desired number of permutations can be set at the time the design is created via the `nperm` argument of `how()`. For example,

```{r, series_2, results="hide"}
how(nperm = 10, within = Within(type = "series"))
```

Internally, `shuffle()` and `shuffleSet()` are very similar, with the major difference being that `shuffleSet()` arranges repeated calls to the workhorse permutation-generating functions, only incurring the overhead associated with interpreting the permutation design once. `shuffleSet()` returns a matrix where the rows represent different permutations in the set.

As an illustration, consider again the simple time series example from earlier. Here I generate a set of 5 permutations from the design, with the results returned as a matrix

```{r, shuffleSet_1}
set.seed(4)
CTRL <- how(within = Within(type = "series"))
pset <- shuffleSet(10, nset = 5, control = CTRL)
pset
```

It is worth taking a moment to explain what has happened here, behind the scenes. There are only `r numPerms(10, CTRL)` unique orderings (including the observed) in the set of permutations for this design. Such a small set of permutations triggers[^1] the generation of the entire set of permutations. From this set, `shuffleSet()` samples at random `nset` permutations. Hence the same number of random values has been generated via the pseudo-random number generator in *R* but we ensure a set of unique permutations is drawn, rather than randomly sample from a small set.

[^1]: The trigger is via the utility function `check()`, which calls another utility function, `allPerms()`, to generate the set of permutations for the stated design. The trigger for complete enumeration is set via `how()` using argument `minperm`; below this value, by default `check()` will generate the entire set of permutations.

# Defining permutation designs
In this section I give examples how various permutation designs can be specified using `how()`. It is not the intention to provide exhaustive coverage of all possible designs that can be produced; such a list would be tedious to both write *and* read. Instead, the main features and options will be described through a series of examples. The reader should then be able to put together the various options to create the exact structure required.

## Set the number of permutations
It may be useful to specify the number of permutations required in a permutation test alongside the permutation design. This is done via the `nperm` argument, as seen earlier. If nothing else is specified
```{r, results="hide"}
how(nperm = 999)
```
would indicate 999 random permutations where the samples are all freely exchangeable.

One advantage of using `nperm` is that `shuffleSet()` will use this if the `nset` argument is not specified. Additionally, `shuffleSet()` will check to see if the desired number of permutations is possible given the data and the requested design. This is done via the function `check()`, which is discussed later.

## The levels of the permutation hierarchy
There are three levels at which permutations can be controlled in *permute*. The highest level of the hierarchy is the *block* level. Blocks are defined by a factor variable. Blocks restrict permutation of samples to within the levels of this factor; samples are never swapped between blocks.

The *plot* level sits below blocks. Plots are defined by a factor and group samples in the same way as blocks. As such, some permutation designs can be initiated using a factor at the plot level or the same factor at the block level. The major difference between blocks and plots is that plots can also be permuted, whereas blocks are never permuted.

The lowest level of a permutation design in the *permute* hierarchy is known as *within*, and refers to samples nested *within* plots. If there are no plots or blocks, how samples are permuted at the *within* level applies to the entire data set.

### Permuting samples at the lowest level

How samples at the *within* level are permuted is configured using the `Within()` function. It takes the following arguments
```{r, withinArgs, echo=FALSE}
args(Within)
```

`type`
 ~ controls how the samples at the lowest level are permuted. The default is to form unrestricted permutations via option `"type"`. Options `"series"` and `"grid"` form restricted permutations via cyclic or toroidal shifts, respectively. The former is useful for samples that are a time series or line-transect, whilst the latter is used for samples on a regular spatial grid. The final option, `"none"`, will result in the samples at the lowest level not being permuted at all. This option is only of practical use when there are plots within the permutation/experimental design[^As blocks are never permuted, using `type = "none"` at the *within* level is also of no practical use.].

`constant`
 ~ this argument only has an effect when there are plots in the design[^Owing to the current implementation, whilst this option could also be useful when blocks to define groups of samples, it will not have any influence over how permutations are generated. As such, only use blocks for simple blocking structures and use plots if you require greater control of the permutations at the group (i.e. plot) level.]. `constant = TRUE` stipulates that each plot should have the same *within-plot* permutation. This is useful for example when you have time series of observations from several plots. If all plots were sampled at the same time points, it can be argued that at the plot level, the samples experienced the same *time* and hence the same permutation should be used within each plot.

`mirror`
 ~ when `type` is `"series"` or `"grid"`, argument `"mirror"` controls whether permutations are taken from the mirror image of the observed ordering in space or time. Consider the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4`. The relationship between observations is also preserved if we reverse the original ordering to `4, 3, 2, 1` and generate permutations from both these orderings. This is what happens when `mirror = TRUE`. For time series, the reversed ordering `4, 3, 2, 1` would imply an influence of observation 4 on observation 3, which is implausible. For spatial grids or line transects, however, this is a sensible option, and can significantly increase the number of possible permutations[^Setting `mirror = TRUE` will double or quadruple the set of permutations for `"series"` or `"grid"` permutations, respectively, as long as there are more than two time points or columns in the grid.].

`ncol`, `nrow`
 ~ define the dimensions of the spatial grid.

How `Within()` is used has already been encountered in earlier sections of this vignette; the function is used to supply a value to the `within` argument of `how()`. You may have noticed that all the arguments of `Within()` have default values? This means that the user need only supply a modified value for the arguments they wish to change. Also, arguments that are not relevant for the type of permutation stated are simply ignored; `nrow` and `ncol`, for example, could be set to any value without affecting the permutation design if `type != "grid"`[^No warnings are currently given if incompatible arguments are specified; they are ignored, but may show up in the printed output. This infelicity will be removed prior to *permute* version 1.0-0 being released.].

### Permuting samples at the Plot level

Permutation of samples at the *plot* level is configured via the `Plots()` function. As with `Within()`, `Plots()` is supplied to the `plots` argument of `how()`. `Plots()` takes many of the same arguments as `Within()`, the two differences being `strata`, a factor variable that describes the grouping of samples at the *plot* level, and the absence of a `constant` argument. As the majority of arguments are similar between `Within()` and `Plots()`, I will not repeat the details again, and only describe the `strata` argument

`strata`
 ~ a factor variable. `strata` describes the grouping of samples at the *plot* level, where samples from the same *plot* are take the same *level* of the factor.

When a *plot*-level design is specified, samples are never permuted between *plots*, only within plots if they are permuted at all. Hence, the type of permutation *within* the *plots* is controlled by `Within()`. Note also that with `Plots()`, the way the individual *plots* are permuted can be from any one of the four basic permutation types; `"none"`, `"free"`, `"series"`, and `"grid"`, as described above. To permute the *plots* only (i.e. retain the ordering of the samples *within* plots), you also need to specify `Within(type = "none", ...)` as the default in `Within()` is `type = "free"`. The ability to permute the plots whilst preserving the within-plot ordering is an impotant feature in testing explanatory factors at the whole-plot level in split-plot designs and in multifactorial analysis of variance [@canoco5manual].

### Specifying blocks; the top of the *permute* hierarchy

In constrast to the *within* and *plots* levels, the *blocks* level is simple to specify; all that is required is an indicator variable the same length as the data. Usually this is a factor, but `how()` will take anything that can be coerced to a factor via `as.factor()`.

It is worth repeating what the role of the block-level structure is; blocks simply restrict permutation to *within*, and never between, blocks, and blocks are never permuted. This is reflected in the implementation; the *split*-*apply*-`combine` paradigm is used to split on the blocking factor, the plot- and within-level permutation design is applied separately to each block, and finally the sets of permutations for each block are recombined.

## Examples
To do.

# Using *permute* in *R* functions

*permute* originally started life as a set of functions contained within the *vegan* package [@vegan] designed to provide a replacement for the `permuted.index()` function. From these humble origins, I realised other users and package authors might want to make use of the code I was writing and so Jari oksanen, the maintainer of *vegan*, and I decided to spin off the code into the *permute* package. Hence from the very beginning, *permute* was intended for use both by users, to defining permutation designs, and by package authors, with which to implement permutation tests within their packages.

In the previous sections, I described the various user-facing functions that are employed to set up permutation designs and generate permutations from these. Here I will outline how package authors can use functionality in the *permute* package to implement permutation tests.

In Section~\@ref{sec:simple} I showed how a permutation test function could be written using the `shuffle()` function and allowing the user to pass into the test function an object created with `how()`. As mentioned earlier, it is more efficient to generate a set of permutations via a call to `shuffleSet()` than to repeatedly call `shuffle()` and large number of times. Another advantage of using `shuffleSet()` is that once the set of permutations has been created, parallel processing can be used to break the set of permutations down into smaller chunks, each of which can be worked on simultaneously. As a result, package authors are encouraged to use `shuffleSet()` instead of the simpler `shuffle()`.

To illustrate how to use *permute* in *R* functions, I'll rework the permutation test I used for the `jackal` data earlier in Section~\@ref{sec:simple}.

```{r, ptest-fun}
pt.test <- function(x, group, nperm = 199) {
    ## mean difference function
    meanDif <- function(i, x, grp) {
        grp <- grp[i]
        mean(x[grp == "Male"]) - mean(x[grp == "Female"])
    }
    ## check x and group are of same length
    stopifnot(all.equal(length(x), length(group)))
    ## number of observations
    N <- nobs(x)
    ## generate the required set of permutations
    pset <- shuffleSet(N, nset = nperm)
    ## iterate over the set of permutations applying meanDif
    D <- apply(pset, 1, meanDif, x = x, grp = group)
    ## add on the observed mean difference
    D <- c(meanDif(seq_len(N), x, group), D)
    ## compute & return the p-value
    Ds <- sum(D >= D[1]) # how many >= to the observed diff?
    Ds / (nperm + 1)     # what proportion of perms is this (the pval)?
}
```

The commented function should be reasonably self explanatory. I've altered the in-line version of the `meanDif()` function to take a vector of permutation indices `i` as the first argument, and internally the `grp` vector is permuted according to `i`. The other major change is that `shuffleSet()` is used to generate a set of permutations, which are then iterated over using `apply()`.

In use we see
```{r, run-ptest}
set.seed(42) ## same seed as earlier
pval <- with(jackal, pt.test(Length, Sex, nperm = 4999))
pval
```
which nicely agrees with the test we did earlier by hand.

Iterating over a set of permutation indices also means that adding parallel processing of the permutations requires only trivial changes to the main function code. As an illustration, below I show a parallel version of `pt.test()`

```{r, parallel-ptest-fun}
ppt.test <- function(x, group, nperm = 199, cores = 2) {
    ## mean difference function
    meanDif <- function(i, .x, .grp) {
        .grp <- .grp[i]
        mean(.x[.grp == "Male"]) - mean(.x[.grp == "Female"])
    }
    ## check x and group are of same length
    stopifnot(all.equal(length(x), length(group)))
    ## number of observations
    N <- nobs(x)
    ## generate the required set of permutations
    pset <- shuffleSet(N, nset = nperm)
    if (cores > 1) {
        ## initiate a cluster
        cl <- makeCluster(cores)
        on.exit(stopCluster(cl = cl))
        ## iterate over the set of permutations applying meanDif
        D <- parRapply(cl, pset, meanDif, .x = x, .grp = group)
    } else {
        D <- apply(pset, 1, meanDif, .x = x, .grp = group)
    }
    ## add on the observed mean difference
    D <- c(meanDif(seq_len(N), x, group), D)
    ## compute & return the p-value
    Ds <- sum(D >= D[1]) # how many >= to the observed diff?
    Ds / (nperm + 1)     # what proportion of perms is this (the pval)?
}
```

In use we observe
```{r, run-pptest}
require("parallel")
set.seed(42)
system.time(ppval <- ppt.test(jackal$Length, jackal$Sex, nperm = 9999,
                              cores = 2))
ppval
```
In this case there is little to be gained by splitting the computations over two CPU cores
```{r, run-pptest2}
set.seed(42)
system.time(ppval2 <- ppt.test(jackal$Length, jackal$Sex, nperm = 9999,
                               cores = 1))
ppval2
```
The cost of setting up and managing the parallel processes, and recombining the separate sets of results almost negates the gain in running the permutations in parallel. Here, the computations involved in `meanDif()` are trivial and we would expect greater efficiencies from running the permutations in parallel for more complex analyses.

## Accesing and changing permutation designs

The object created by `how()` is a relatively simple list containing the settings for the specified permutation design. As such one could use the standard subsetting and replacement functions in base *R* to alter components of the list. This is not recommended, however, as the internal structure of the list returned by `how()` may change in a later version of *permute*. Furthermore, to facilitate the use of `update()` at the user-level to alter the permutation design in a user-friendly way, the matched `how()` call is stored within the list along with the matched calls for any `Within()` or `Plots()` components. These matched calls need to be updated too if the list describing the permutation design is altered. To allow function writers to access and alter permutation designs, *permute* provides a series of extractor and replacement functions that have the forms `getFoo()` and `setFoo<-()`, respectively,where `Foo` is replaced by a particular component to be extracted or replaced.

The `getFoo()` functions provided by *permute* are

`getWithin()`, `getPlots()`, `getBlocks()`
 ~ these extract the details of the *within*-, *plots*-, and *blocks*-level components of the design. Given the current design (as of *permute* version 0.8-0), the first two of these return lists with classes `"Within"` and `"Plots"`, respectively, whilst `getBlocks()` returns the block-level factor.

`getStrata()`
 ~ returns the factor describing the grouping of samples at the *plots* or *blocks* levels, as determined by the value of argument `which`.

`getType()`
 ~ returns the type of permutation of samples at the *within* or *plots* levels, as determined by the value of argument `which`.

`getMirror()`
 ~ returns a logical, indicating whether permutations are drawn from the mirror image of the observed ordering at the *within* or *plots* levels, as determined by the value of argument `which`.

`getConstant()`
 ~ returns a logical, indicating whether the same permutation of samples, or a different permutation, is used within each of the plots.

`getRow()`, `getCol()`, `getDim()`
 ~ return dimensions of the spatial grid of samples at the *plots* or *blocks* levels, as determined by the value of argument `which`.

`getNperm()`, `getMaxperm()`, `getMinperm()`
 ~ return numerics for the stored number of permutations requested plus two triggers used when checking permutation designs via `check()`.

`getComplete()`
 ~ returns a logical, indicating whether complete enumeration of the set of permutations was requested.

`getMake()`
 ~ returns a logical, indicating whether the entire set of permutations should be produced or not.

`getObserved()`
 ~ returns a logical, which indicates whether the observed permutation (ordering of samples) is included in the entire set of permutation generated by `allPerms()`.

`getAllperms()`
 ~ extracts the complete set of permutations if present. Returns `NULL` if the set has not been generated.

The available `setFoo()<-` functions are

`setPlots<-()`, `setWithin<-()`
 ~ replaces the details of the *within*-, and *plots*-, components of the design. The replacement object must be of class `"Plots"` or `"Within"`, respectively, and hence is most usefully used in combination with the `Plots()` or `Within()` constructor functions.

`setBlocks<-()`
 ~ replaces the factor that partitions the observations into blocks. `value` can be any *R* object that can be coerced to a factor vector via `as.factor()`.

`setStrata<-()`
 ~ replaces either the `blocks` or `strata` components of the design, depending on what class of object `setStrata<-()` is applied to. When used on an object of class `"how"`, `setStrata<-()` replaces the `blocks` component of that object. When used on an object of class `"Plots"`, `setStrata<-()` replaces the `strata` component of that object. In both cases a factor variable is required and the replacement object will be coerced to a factor via `as.factor()` if possible.

`setType<-()`
 ~ replaces the `type` component of an object of class `"Plots"` or `"Within"` with a character vector of length one. Must be one of the available types: `"none"`, `"free"`, `"series"`, or `"grid"`.

`setMirror<-()`
 ~ replaces the `mirror` component of an object of class `"Plots"` or `"Within"` with a logical vector of length one.

`setConstant<-()`
 ~ replaces the `constant` component of an object of class `"Within"` with a logical vector of length one.

`setRow<-()`, `setCol<-()`, `setDim<-()`
 ~ replace one or both of the spatial grid dimensions of an object of class `"Plots"` or `"Within"` with am integer vector of length one, or, in the case of `setDim<-()`, of length 2.

`setNperm<-()`, `setMinperm<-()`, `setMaxperm<-()`
 ~ update the stored values for the requested number of permutations and the minimum and maximum permutation thresholds that control whether the entire set of permutations is generated instead of `nperm` permutations.

`setAllperms<-()`
 ~ assigns a matrix of permutation indices to the `all.perms` component of the design list object.

`setComplete<-()`
 ~ updates the status of the `complete` setting. Takes a logical vector of length 1 or any object coercible to such.

`setMake<-()`
 ~ sets the indicator controlling whether the entrie set of permutations is generated during checking of the design via `check()`. Takes a logical vector of length 1 or any object coercible to such.

`setObserved<-()`
 ~ updates the indicator of whether the observed ordering is included in the set of all permutations should they be generated. Takes a logical vector of length 1 or any object coercible to such.

*Examples*

I illustrate the behaviour of the `getFoo()` and `setFoo<-()` functions through a couple of simple examples. Firstly, generate a design object
```{r, get-set-eg0}
hh <- how()
```
This design is one of complete randomization, so all of the settings in the object take their default values. The default number of permutations is currently `r getNperm(hh)`, and can be extracted using `getNperm()`
```{r, get-set-eg1}
getNperm(hh)
```
The corresponding replacement function can be use to alter the number of permutations after the design has been generated. To illustrate a finer point of the behaviour of these replacement functions, compare the matched call stored in `hh` before and after the number of permutations is changed
```{r, <get-set-eg2}
getCall(hh)
setNperm(hh) <- 999
getNperm(hh)
getCall(hh)
```
Note how the `call` component has been altered to include the argument pair `nperm = 999`, hence if this call were evaluated, the resulting object would be a copy of `hh`.

As a more complex example, consider the following design consisting of 5 blocks, each containing 2 plots of 5 samples each. Hence there are a total of 10 plots. Both the plots and within-plot sample are time series. This design can be created using
```{r, get-set-eg3}
hh <- how(within = Within(type = "series"),
          plots = Plots(type = "series", strata = gl(10, 5)),
          blocks = gl(5, 10))
```

To alter the design at the plot or within-plot levels, it is convenient to extract the relevant component using `getPlots()` or `getWithin()`, update the extracted object, and finally use the updated object to update `hh`. This process is illustrated below in order to change the plot-level permutation type to `"free"`
```{r, get-set-eg4}
pl <- getPlots(hh)
setType(pl) <- "free"
setPlots(hh) <- pl
```
We can confirm this has been changed by extracting the permutation type for the plot level
```{r, get-set-eg5}
getType(hh, which = "plots")
```
Notice too how the call has been expanded from `gl(10, 5)` to an integer vector. This expansion is to avoid the obvious problem of locating the objects referred to in the call should the call be re-evaluated later.
```{r, get-set-eg6}
getCall(getPlots(hh))
```

At the top level, a user can update the design using `update()`. Hence the equivalent of the above update is (this time resetting the original type; `type = "series"`)
```{r, get-set-eg7}
hh <- update(hh, plots = update(getPlots(hh), type = "series"))
getType(hh, which = "plots")
```
However, this approach is not assured of working within a function because we do not guarantee that components of the call used to create `hh` can be found from the execution frame where `update()` is called. To be safe, always use the `setFoo<-()` replacement functions to update design objects from within your functions.

<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In classical frequentist statistics, the significance of a relationship or model is determined by reference to a null distribution for the test statistic. This distribution is derived mathematically and the probability of achieving a test statistic as large or larger if the null hypothesis were true is looked-up from this null distribution. In deriving this probability, some assumptions about the data or the errors are made. If these assumptions are violated, then the validity of the derived <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value may be questioned.</p>
<p>An alternative to deriving the null distribution from theory is to generate a null distribution of the test statistic by randomly shuffling the data in some manner, refitting the model and deriving values for the test statistic for the permuted data. The level of significance of the test can be computed as the proportion of values of the test statistic from the null distribution that are equal to or larger than the observed value.</p>
<p>In many data sets, simply shuffling the data at random is inappropriate; under the null hypothesis, that data are not freely exchangeable, for example if there is temporal or spatial correlation, or the samples are clustered in some way, such as multiple samples collected from each of a number of fields. The <em>permute</em> package was designed to provide facilities for generating these restricted permutations for use in randomisation tests. <em>permute</em> takes as its motivation the permutation schemes originally available in <em>Canoco</em> version 3.1 <span class="citation">(Braak 1990)</span>, which employed the cyclic- or toroidal-shifts suggested by <span class="citation">Besag and Clifford (1989)</span>.</p>

<h1>Simple randomisation</h1>
<p>As an illustration of both randomisation and simple usage of the <em>permute</em> package we consider a small data set of mandible length measurements on specimens of the golden jackal (<em>Canis aureus</em>) from the British Museum of Natural History, London, UK. These data were collected as part of a study comparing prehistoric and modern canids <span class="citation">(Higham, Kijngam, and Manly 1980)</span>, and were analysed by <span class="citation">Manly (2007)</span>. There are ten measurements of mandible length on both male and female specimens. The data are available in the <code>jackal</code> data frame supplied with <em>permute</em>.</p>

<p>The interest is whether there is a difference in the mean mandible length between male and female golden jackals. The null hypothesis is that there is zero difference in mandible length between the two sexes or that females have larger mandibles. The alternative hypothesis is that males have larger mandibles. The usual statistical test of this hypothesis is a one-sided <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> test, which can be applied using <code>t.test()</code></p>

<p>The observed <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is 3.484 with 18 df. The probability of observing a value this large or larger if the null hypothesis were true is 0.0013. Several assumptions have been made in deriving this <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value, namely</p>
<ul>
<li>random sampling of individuals from the populations of interest,</li>
<li>equal population standard deviations for males and females, and</li>
<li>that the mandible lengths are normally distributed within the sexes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assumption 1 is unlikely to be valid for museum specimens such as these, that have been collected in some unknown manner. Assumption 2 may be valid, Fisherâ€™s <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-test and a Fligner-Killeen test both suggest that the standard deviations of the two populations do not differ significantly</p>
<pre class="rftest_jackal"><code>var.test(Length ~ Sex, data = jackal)
fligner.test(Length ~ Sex, data = jackal)</code></pre>
<p>This assumption may be relaxed using <code>var.equal = FALSE</code> (the default) in the call to <code>t.test()</code>, to employ Welchâ€™s modification for unequal variances. Assumption 3 may be valid, but with such a small sample we are unable to reliably test this.</p>
<p>A randomisation test of the same hypothesis can be performed by randomly allocating ten of the mandible lengths to the male group and the remaining lengths to the female group. This randomisation is justified under the null hypothesis because the observed difference in mean mandible length between the two sexes is just a typical value for the difference in a sample if there were no difference in the population. An appropriate test statistic needs to be selected. We could use the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> statistic as derived in the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test. Alternatively, we could base our randomisation test on the difference of means <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> (male - female).</p>
<p>The main function in <em>permute</em> for providing random permutations is <code>shuffle()</code>. We can write our own randomisation test for the <code>jackal</code> data by first creating a function to compute the difference of means for two groups</p>

<p>which can be used in a simple <code>for()</code> loop to generate the null distribution for the difference of means. First, we allocate some storage to hold the null difference of means; here we use 4999 random permutations so allocate a vector of length 5000. Then we iterate, randomly generating an ordering of the <code>Sex</code> vector and computing the difference of means for that permutation.</p>

<p>The observed difference of means was added to the null distribution, because under the null hypothesis the observed allocation of mandible lengths to male and female jackals is just one of the possible random allocations.</p>
<p>The null distribution of <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> can be visualised using a histogram, as shown in Figure~@ref{draw_hist_jackal}. The observed difference of means (4.8) is indicated by the red tick mark.</p>

Where <code>shuffle()</code> comes into itâ€™s own is for generating permutation indices from restricted permutation designs.</p>

<h1>The <code>shuffle()</code> and <code>shuffleSet()</code> functions</h1>
<p>In the previous section I introduced the <code>shuffle()</code> function to generate permutation indices for use in a randomisation test. Now we will take a closer look at <code>shuffle()</code> and explore the various restricted permutation designs from which it can generate permutation indices.</p>
<p><code>shuffle()</code> has two arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><code>n</code>, the number of observations in the data set to be permuted, and</li>
<li><code>control</code>, a list that defines the permutation design describing how the samples should be permuted.</li>

<p>A series of convenience functions are provided that allow the user to set-up even quite complex permutation designs with little effort.

<h2>Generating restricted permutations</h2>
<p>Several types of permutation are available in <em>permute</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free permutation of objects</li>
<li>Time series or line transect designs, where the temporal or spatial ordering is preserved.</li>
<li>Spatial grid designs, where the spatial ordering is preserved in both coordinate directions</li>
<li>Permutation of plots or groups of samples.</li>
<li>Blocking factors which restrict permutations to within blocks. The preceding designs can be nested within blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three of these can be nested within the levels of a factor or to the levels of that factor, or to both. Such flexibility allows the analysis of split-plot designs using permutation tests, especially when combined with blocks.</p>
<p><code>how()</code> is used to set up the design from which <code>shuffle()</code> will draw a permutation. <code>how()</code> has two main arguments that specify how samples are permuted <em>within</em> plots of samples or at the plot level itself. These are <code>within</code> and <code>plots</code>. Two convenience functions, <code>Within()</code> and <code>Plots()</code> can be used to set the various options for permutation. Blocks operate at the uppermost level of this hierarchy; blocks define groups of plots, each of which may contain groups of samples.</p>
<p>For example, to permute the observations <code>1:10</code> assuming a time series design for the entire set of observations, the following control object would be used</p>

<h2>Generating sets of permutations with shuffleSet()</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why one might wish to generate a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> permutations instead of repeatedly generating permutations one at a time. Interpreting the permutation design happens each time <code>shuffle()</code> is called. This is an unnecessary computational burden, especially if you want to perform tests with large numbers of permutations. Furthermore, having the set of permutations available allows for expedited use with other functions, they can be iterated over using <code>for</code> loops or the <code>apply</code> family of functions, and the set of permutations can be exported for use outside of R.</p>
<p>The <code>shuffleSet()</code> function allows the generation of sets of permutations from any of the designs available in <em>permute</em>. <code>shuffleSet()</code> takes an additional argument to that of <code>shuffle()</code>, <code>nset</code>, which is the number of permutations required for the set. <code>nset</code> can be missing, in which case the number of permutations in the set is looked for in the object passed to <code>control</code>; using this, the desired number of permutations can be set at the time the design is created via the <code>nperm</code> argument of <code>how()</code>. For example,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb37-1" title="1"><span class="kw">how</span>(<span class="dt">nperm =</span> <span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">within =</span> <span class="kw">Within</span>(<span class="dt">type =</span> <span class="st">&quot;series&quot;</span>))</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Internally, <code>shuffle()</code> and <code>shuffleSet()</code> are very similar, with the major difference being that <code>shuffleSet()</code> arranges repeated calls to the workhorse permutation-generating functions, only incurring the overhead associated with interpreting the permutation design once. <code>shuffleSet()</code> returns a matrix where the rows represent different permutations in the set.</p>
<p>As an illustration, consider again the simple time series example from earlier. Here I generate a set of 5 permutations from the design, with the results returned as a matrix</p>

<p>It is worth taking a moment to explain what has happened here, behind the scenes. There are only 10 unique orderings (including the observed) in the set of permutations for this design. Such a small set of permutations triggers<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the generation of the entire set of permutations. From this set, <code>shuffleSet()</code> samples at random <code>nset</code> permutations. Hence the same number of random values has been generated via the pseudo-random number generator in <em>R</em> but we ensure a set of unique permutations is drawn, rather than randomly sample from a small set.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="defining-permutation-designs" class="section level1">
<h1>Defining permutation designs</h1>
<p>In this section I give examples how various permutation designs can be specified using <code>how()</code>. It is not the intention to provide exhaustive coverage of all possible designs that can be produced; such a list would be tedious to both write <em>and</em> read. Instead, the main features and options will be described through a series of examples. The reader should then be able to put together the various options to create the exact structure required.</p>
<div id="set-the-number-of-permutations" class="section level2">
<h2>Set the number of permutations</h2>
<p>It may be useful to specify the number of permutations required in a permutation test alongside the permutation design. This is done via the <code>nperm</code> argument, as seen earlier. If nothing else is specified</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb40-1" title="1"><span class="kw">how</span>(<span class="dt">nperm =</span> <span class="dv">999</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>would indicate 999 random permutations where the samples are all freely exchangeable.</p>
<p>One advantage of using <code>nperm</code> is that <code>shuffleSet()</code> will use this if the <code>nset</code> argument is not specified. Additionally, <code>shuffleSet()</code> will check to see if the desired number of permutations is possible given the data and the requested design. This is done via the function <code>check()</code>, which is discussed later.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-levels-of-the-permutation-hierarchy" class="section level2">
<h2>The levels of the permutation hierarchy</h2>
<p>There are three levels at which permutations can be controlled in <em>permute</em>. The highest level of the hierarchy is the <em>block</em> level. Blocks are defined by a factor variable. Blocks restrict permutation of samples to within the levels of this factor; samples are never swapped between blocks.</p>
<p>The <em>plot</em> level sits below blocks. Plots are defined by a factor and group samples in the same way as blocks. As such, some permutation designs can be initiated using a factor at the plot level or the same factor at the block level. The major difference between blocks and plots is that plots can also be permuted, whereas blocks are never permuted.</p>
<p>The lowest level of a permutation design in the <em>permute</em> hierarchy is known as <em>within</em>, and refers to samples nested <em>within</em> plots. If there are no plots or blocks, how samples are permuted at the <em>within</em> level applies to the entire data set.</p>
<div id="permuting-samples-at-the-lowest-level" class="section level3">
<h3>Permuting samples at the lowest level</h3>
<p>How samples at the <em>within</em> level are permuted is configured using the <code>Within()</code> function. It takes the following arguments</p>
<pre><code>## function (type = c(&quot;free&quot;, &quot;series&quot;, &quot;grid&quot;, &quot;none&quot;), constant = FALSE, 
##     mirror = FALSE, ncol = NULL, nrow = NULL) 
## NULL</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt><code>type</code></dt>
<dd>controls how the samples at the lowest level are permuted. The default is to form unrestricted permutations via option <code>&quot;type&quot;</code>. Options <code>&quot;series&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;grid&quot;</code> form restricted permutations via cyclic or toroidal shifts, respectively. The former is useful for samples that are a time series or line-transect, whilst the latter is used for samples on a regular spatial grid. The final option, <code>&quot;none&quot;</code>, will result in the samples at the lowest level not being permuted at all. This option is only of practical use when there are plots within the permutation/experimental design[^As blocks are never permuted, using <code>type = &quot;none&quot;</code> at the <em>within</em> level is also of no practical use.].
</dd>
<dt><code>constant</code></dt>
<dd>this argument only has an effect when there are plots in the design[^Owing to the current implementation, whilst this option could also be useful when blocks to define groups of samples, it will not have any influence over how permutations are generated. As such, only use blocks for simple blocking structures and use plots if you require greater control of the permutations at the group (i.e.Â plot) level.]. <code>constant = TRUE</code> stipulates that each plot should have the same <em>within-plot</em> permutation. This is useful for example when you have time series of observations from several plots. If all plots were sampled at the same time points, it can be argued that at the plot level, the samples experienced the same <em>time</em> and hence the same permutation should be used within each plot.
</dd>
<dt><code>mirror</code></dt>
<dd>when <code>type</code> is <code>&quot;series&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;grid&quot;</code>, argument <code>&quot;mirror&quot;</code> controls whether permutations are taken from the mirror image of the observed ordering in space or time. Consider the sequence <code>1, 2, 3, 4</code>. The relationship between observations is also preserved if we reverse the original ordering to <code>4, 3, 2, 1</code> and generate permutations from both these orderings. This is what happens when <code>mirror = TRUE</code>. For time series, the reversed ordering <code>4, 3, 2, 1</code> would imply an influence of observation 4 on observation 3, which is implausible. For spatial grids or line transects, however, this is a sensible option, and can significantly increase the number of possible permutations[^Setting <code>mirror = TRUE</code> will double or quadruple the set of permutations for <code>&quot;series&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;grid&quot;</code> permutations, respectively, as long as there are more than two time points or columns in the grid.].
</dd>
<dt><code>ncol</code>, <code>nrow</code></dt>
<dd>define the dimensions of the spatial grid.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>How <code>Within()</code> is used has already been encountered in earlier sections of this vignette; the function is used to supply a value to the <code>within</code> argument of <code>how()</code>. You may have noticed that all the arguments of <code>Within()</code> have default values? This means that the user need only supply a modified value for the arguments they wish to change. Also, arguments that are not relevant for the type of permutation stated are simply ignored; <code>nrow</code> and <code>ncol</code>, for example, could be set to any value without affecting the permutation design if <code>type != &quot;grid&quot;</code>[^No warnings are currently given if incompatible arguments are specified; they are ignored, but may show up in the printed output. This infelicity will be removed prior to <em>permute</em> version 1.0-0 being released.].</p>
</div>
<div id="permuting-samples-at-the-plot-level" class="section level3">
<h3>Permuting samples at the Plot level</h3>
<p>Permutation of samples at the <em>plot</em> level is configured via the <code>Plots()</code> function. As with <code>Within()</code>, <code>Plots()</code> is supplied to the <code>plots</code> argument of <code>how()</code>. <code>Plots()</code> takes many of the same arguments as <code>Within()</code>, the two differences being <code>strata</code>, a factor variable that describes the grouping of samples at the <em>plot</em> level, and the absence of a <code>constant</code> argument. As the majority of arguments are similar between <code>Within()</code> and <code>Plots()</code>, I will not repeat the details again, and only describe the <code>strata</code> argument</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>strata</code></dt>
<dd>a factor variable. <code>strata</code> describes the grouping of samples at the <em>plot</em> level, where samples from the same <em>plot</em> are take the same <em>level</em> of the factor.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a <em>plot</em>-level design is specified, samples are never permuted between <em>plots</em>, only within plots if they are permuted at all. Hence, the type of permutation <em>within</em> the <em>plots</em> is controlled by <code>Within()</code>. Note also that with <code>Plots()</code>, the way the individual <em>plots</em> are permuted can be from any one of the four basic permutation types; <code>&quot;none&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;free&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;series&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;grid&quot;</code>, as described above. To permute the <em>plots</em> only (i.e.Â retain the ordering of the samples <em>within</em> plots), you also need to specify <code>Within(type = &quot;none&quot;, ...)</code> as the default in <code>Within()</code> is <code>type = &quot;free&quot;</code>. The ability to permute the plots whilst preserving the within-plot ordering is an impotant feature in testing explanatory factors at the whole-plot level in split-plot designs and in multifactorial analysis of variance <span class="citation">(Braak and Å milauer 2012)</span>.</p>

<h3>Specifying blocks; the top of the <em>permute</em> hierarchy</h3>
<p>In constrast to the <em>within</em> and <em>plots</em> levels, the <em>blocks</em> level is simple to specify; all that is required is an indicator variable the same length as the data. Usually this is a factor, but <code>how()</code> will take anything that can be coerced to a factor via <code>as.factor()</code>.</p>
<p>It is worth repeating what the role of the block-level structure is; blocks simply restrict permutation to <em>within</em>, and never between, blocks, and blocks are never permuted. This is reflected in the implementation; the <em>split</em>-<em>apply</em>-<code>combine</code> paradigm is used to split on the blocking factor, the plot- and within-level permutation design is applied separately to each block, and finally the sets of permutations for each block are recombined.</p>

<h1>Using <em>permute</em> in <em>R</em> functions</h1>
<p><em>permute</em> originally started life as a set of functions contained within the <em>vegan</em> package <span class="citation">(Oksanen et al. 2013)</span> designed to provide a replacement for the <code>permuted.index()</code> function. From these humble origins, I realised other users and package authors might want to make use of the code I was writing and so Jari oksanen, the maintainer of <em>vegan</em>, and I decided to spin off the code into the <em>permute</em> package. Hence from the very beginning, <em>permute</em> was intended for use both by users, to defining permutation designs, and by package authors, with which to implement permutation tests within their packages.</p>
<p>In the previous sections, I described the various user-facing functions that are employed to set up permutation designs and generate permutations from these. Here I will outline how package authors can use functionality in the <em>permute</em> package to implement permutation tests.</p>
<p>In Section~@ref{sec:simple} I showed how a permutation test function could be written using the <code>shuffle()</code> function and allowing the user to pass into the test function an object created with <code>how()</code>. As mentioned earlier, it is more efficient to generate a set of permutations via a call to <code>shuffleSet()</code> than to repeatedly call <code>shuffle()</code> and large number of times. Another advantage of using <code>shuffleSet()</code> is that once the set of permutations has been created, parallel processing can be used to break the set of permutations down into smaller chunks, each of which can be worked on simultaneously. As a result, package authors are encouraged to use <code>shuffleSet()</code> instead of the simpler <code>shuffle()</code>.</p>
<p>To illustrate how to use <em>permute</em> in <em>R</em> functions, Iâ€™ll rework the permutation test I used for the <code>jackal</code> data earlier in Section~@ref{sec:simple}.</p>

<p>The commented function should be reasonably self explanatory. Iâ€™ve altered the in-line version of the <code>meanDif()</code> function to take a vector of permutation indices <code>i</code> as the first argument, and internally the <code>grp</code> vector is permuted according to <code>i</code>. The other major change is that <code>shuffleSet()</code> is used to generate a set of permutations, which are then iterated over using <code>apply()</code>.</p>

<p>The cost of setting up and managing the parallel processes, and recombining the separate sets of results almost negates the gain in running the permutations in parallel.

<div id="accesing-and-changing-permutation-designs" class="section level2">
<h2>Accesing and changing permutation designs</h2>
<p>The object created by <code>how()</code> is a relatively simple list containing the settings for the specified permutation design. As such one could use the standard subsetting and replacement functions in base <em>R</em> to alter components of the list. This is not recommended, however, as the internal structure of the list returned by <code>how()</code> may change in a later version of <em>permute</em>. Furthermore, to facilitate the use of <code>update()</code> at the user-level to alter the permutation design in a user-friendly way, the matched <code>how()</code> call is stored within the list along with the matched calls for any <code>Within()</code> or <code>Plots()</code> components. These matched calls need to be updated too if the list describing the permutation design is altered. To allow function writers to access and alter permutation designs, <em>permute</em> provides a series of extractor and replacement functions that have the forms <code>getFoo()</code> and <code>setFoo&lt;-()</code>, respectively,where <code>Foo</code> is replaced by a particular component to be extracted or replaced.</p>
<p>The <code>getFoo()</code> functions provided by <em>permute</em> are</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>getWithin()</code>, <code>getPlots()</code>, <code>getBlocks()</code></dt>
<dd>these extract the details of the <em>within</em>-, <em>plots</em>-, and <em>blocks</em>-level components of the design. Given the current design (as of <em>permute</em> version 0.8-0), the first two of these return lists with classes <code>&quot;Within&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;Plots&quot;</code>, respectively, whilst <code>getBlocks()</code> returns the block-level factor.
</dd>
<dt><code>getStrata()</code></dt>
<dd>returns the factor describing the grouping of samples at the <em>plots</em> or <em>blocks</em> levels, as determined by the value of argument <code>which</code>.

<dd>replaces the details of the <em>within</em>-, and <em>plots</em>-, components of the design. The replacement object must be of class <code>&quot;Plots&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;Within&quot;</code>, respectively, and hence is most usefully used in combination with the <code>Plots()</code> or <code>Within()</code> constructor functions.

<dd>replaces either the <code>blocks</code> or <code>strata</code> components of the design, depending on what class of object <code>setStrata&lt;-()</code> is applied to. When used on an object of class <code>&quot;how&quot;</code>, <code>setStrata&lt;-()</code> replaces the <code>blocks</code> component of that object. When used on an object of class <code>&quot;Plots&quot;</code>, <code>setStrata&lt;-()</code> replaces the <code>strata</code> component of that object.

<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<p>I illustrate the behaviour of the <code>getFoo()</code> and <code>setFoo&lt;-()</code> functions through a couple of simple examples. Firstly, generate a design object</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb54-1" title="1">hh &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">how</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This design is one of complete randomization, so all of the settings in the object take their default values. The default number of permutations is currently 199, and can be extracted using <code>getNperm()</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb55-1" title="1"><span class="kw">getNperm</span>(hh)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 199</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding replacement function can be use to alter the number of permutations after the design has been generated. To illustrate a finer point of the behaviour of these replacement functions, compare the matched call stored in <code>hh</code> before and after the number of permutations is changed</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb57-1" title="1"><span class="kw">getCall</span>(hh)</a></code></pre></div>

<pre><code>## how(nperm = 999)</code></pre>
<p>Note how the <code>call</code> component has been altered to include the argument pair <code>nperm = 999</code>, hence if this call were evaluated, the resulting object would be a copy of <code>hh</code>.</p>
<p>As a more complex example, consider the following design consisting of 5 blocks, each containing 2 plots of 5 samples each. Hence there are a total of 10 plots. Both the plots and within-plot sample are time series. This design can be created using</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb63"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-1" title="1">hh &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">how</span>(<span class="dt">within =</span> <span class="kw">Within</span>(<span class="dt">type =</span> <span class="st">&quot;series&quot;</span>),</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-2" title="2">          <span class="dt">plots =</span> <span class="kw">Plots</span>(<span class="dt">type =</span> <span class="st">&quot;series&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">strata =</span> <span class="kw">gl</span>(<span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>)),</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb63-3" title="3">          <span class="dt">blocks =</span> <span class="kw">gl</span>(<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>))</a></code></pre></div>
<p>To alter the design at the plot or within-plot levels, it is convenient to extract the relevant component using <code>getPlots()</code> or <code>getWithin()</code>, update the extracted object, and finally use the updated object to update <code>hh</code>. This process is illustrated below in order to change the plot-level permutation type to <code>&quot;free&quot;</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb64"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-1" title="1">pl &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">getPlots</span>(hh)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-2" title="2"><span class="kw">setType</span>(pl) &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;free&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb64-3" title="3"><span class="kw">setPlots</span>(hh) &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>pl</a></code></pre></div>
<p>We can confirm this has been changed by extracting the permutation type for the plot level</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb65-1" title="1"><span class="kw">getType</span>(hh, <span class="dt">which =</span> <span class="st">&quot;plots&quot;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;free&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Notice too how the call has been expanded from <code>gl(10, 5)</code> to an integer vector. This expansion is to avoid the obvious problem of locating the objects referred to in the call should the call be re-evaluated later.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb67"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb67-1" title="1"><span class="kw">getCall</span>(<span class="kw">getPlots</span>(hh))</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Plots(strata = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 
## 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 5L, 6L, 6L, 
## 6L, 6L, 6L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 7L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 9L, 9L, 9L, 
## 9L, 9L, 10L, 10L, 10L, 10L, 10L), type = &quot;free&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>At the top level, a user can update the design using <code>update()</code>. Hence the equivalent of the above update is (this time resetting the original type; <code>type = &quot;series&quot;</code>)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb69"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-1" title="1">hh &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">update</span>(hh, <span class="dt">plots =</span> <span class="kw">update</span>(<span class="kw">getPlots</span>(hh), <span class="dt">type =</span> <span class="st">&quot;series&quot;</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb69-2" title="2"><span class="kw">getType</span>(hh, <span class="dt">which =</span> <span class="st">&quot;plots&quot;</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;series&quot;</code></pre>
<p>However, this approach is not assured of working within a function because we do not guarantee that components of the call used to create <code>hh</code> can be found from the execution frame where <code>update()</code> is called. To be safe, always use the <code>setFoo&lt;-()</code> replacement functions to update design objects from within your functions.</p>
